<b><p class="text"> As the name suggests,bussiness-to-bussiness marketing refers to the marketing of products or <br>
    services to other bussinesses and organizations.It holds several key distinctions from B2C<br>
     marketing,which is oriented toward consumers.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In a broad sence,B2B marketing content tends to be more informational and straightforward than<br>
    B2C.This is because bussiness purchase decisions,in comparison to those of consumers,are based <br>
    more on bottom-line revenue impact.Return on investment (ROI) is rarely a consideration for the<br>
    everyday person at least in a monetary sence but it is a primary focus for corperate decision
    <br> makers.
